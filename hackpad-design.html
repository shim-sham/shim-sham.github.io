<h1>hackpad - designing the PCB, case, and code (blog not finished yet - bear with me)<i id="dark-mode-toggle" class="fas fa-moon icon-link" title="Toggle Dark Mode"></i></h1>
          <p>I made this for Hack Club’s <a href = “https://hackpad.hackclub.com/”>Hackpad</a> event.<br>
          This is another project I created to make it more intuitive and easy to create music than simply using a traditional mouse and keyboard setup. Having never even thought about creating hardware before, my aim for this was to learn as much as I could while having fun!

          <h2>step 1: PCB design</h2>
          <img class = "hackpad-blog" src="https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/e82f0cc5c98c0c0247eff62ad14c76a040b09e8d_image.png">
          <p>I based my PCB design off on the event’s tutorial, learning circuit design on the way.</p>

          <p>Wiring was satisfying, graphics/deco… not as easy. But definitely worth it.</p>
          <h2>step 2 - case design</h2>
          <p>I’m gonna be honest, every minute spent on Fusion360 designing that case was a horrible one. Getting used to just using the software was a challenge, but at the end of it, I’m so much more confident with 3D design in general.</p>
